# Lab 5 part 1
For this assignment, I built a CRUD api server for my recipe library application(react+redux front end) that uses express and mongodb. In this application, users can create, read, update, and delete recipes. There is also a comment section in case the chef would like to add personal notes to the recipe. 

### What worked
In general, this lab went pretty smoothly. The repitition of coding more routing functions has been really helpful for learning these concepts. 


### What didn't
When I was adding the comment functionality, I ran into a massive roadblock with how my front-end was handeling API calls and the passing of data. There were some naming issues as well as that were fixed along the way.


### Extra Credit
I changed the tags to store as an array (so it can be split by whitespace) and I changed both the api and front end to support commenting (in the form of a model). 

Procfile set up to run on [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app)

# Lab 5 part 2
For this assignment, I added user authentication to my CRUD api server and front end react+reduct online application. 

### What worked 
The links inbedded in the assignment were very helpful on learning more about the proccess and syntax/direction we needed to go for particular parts of the lab.

### What didn't
This lab definitely took longer than the first part of this lab. Getting all of the authentications and syntax to line up was very difficult and time consuming. 

### Extra Credit
There is still space to comment at the bottom of a single recipe post. There are also alert notifications for when an a user does not fill out all of the fields/there is already an email registered when creating an account. There is also a two step check to make sure that the user wants to log out.
