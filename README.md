# Lab 5 part 1
For this assignment, I built a CRUD api erver for my recipe library application(react+redux front end) that uses express and mongodb. In this application, users can create, read, update, and delete recipes. There is also a comment section in case the chef would like to add personal notes to the recipe. 

### What worked
In general, this lab went pretty smoothly. The repitition of coding more routing functions has been really helpful for learning these concepts. 


### What didn't
When I was adding the comment functionality, I ran into a massive roadblock with how my front-end was handeling API calls and the passing of data. There were some naming issues as well as that were fixed along the way.


### Extra Credit
I changed the tags to store as an array (so it can be split by whitespace) and I changed both the api and front end to support commenting (in the form of a model).
